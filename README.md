App name: Calvin Finds

Calvin currently lacks an efficient and organized system for managing lost and found items on campus. The absence of such a system not only leads to frustration but also results in the unnecessary loss of personal items, which could otherwise be easily recovered with a proper solution in place. Our app, Calvin Finds, aims to offer easy item reporting, streamlined item searches, real-time updates, identifiable pictures, specified locations and community engagement. 

Existing applications are capable of serving a similar function to our app at a larger scale. However, there is no such app curated towards the Calvin community and students do not find it helpful to use an app that covers a wide area that they have not lost an item in. Our app has a focused coverage developed exclusively for Calvin, providing a more customized and secure experience that would include an authentication system for Calvin students. Unlike existing apps, which require listings to include a wide variety of personal information, our application would only require minimal information for a means of communication to be provided with a listing since all users are Calvin students. This would ensure easier setup, quick posting and secure communications. Together, we strive to empower Calvinâ€™s community through effortless lost and found retrievals.
