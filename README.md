## Vision Statement: 

### App name: Calvin Finds
Calvin currently lacks an efficient and organized system for managing lost and found items on campus. The absence of such a system not only leads to frustration but also results in the unnecessary loss of personal items, which could otherwise be easily recovered with a proper solution in place. Our app, Calvin Finds, aims to offer easy item reporting, streamlined item searches, real-time updates, specified locations and community engagement.
