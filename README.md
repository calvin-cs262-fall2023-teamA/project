# Calvin Finds

Calvin currently lacks an efficient and organized system for managing lost and found items on campus. Calvin's current system involves lost-and-found boxes around campus and a written record of lost items. The absence of an easily accessible, on demand system not only leads to frustration but also results in the unnecessary prolonged loss of personal items, which could otherwise be easily recovered with a better solution in place. Our app, Calvin Finds, aims to offer easy item reporting, streamlined item searches, real-time updates, identifiable pictures, specified locations and community engagement. 

Existing applications are larger scale rather than being focused solely on Calvin. Calvin students and faculty would not find it as helpful to use an app that covers a wide area when they lost their item on Calvin's campus. Unlike existing apps, our app would include an authentication system and would only require minimal personal information to be provided with a listing since all users are Calvin students. This would ensure easier setup, quick posting and secure communications. Together, we strive to empower Calvin’s community through effortless lost and found retrievals.
