### Vision Statement: 
*“Include a brief, comparative analysis of other related/competing systems.”*

App name: Calvin Finds
Calvin currently lacks an efficient and organized system for managing lost and found items on campus. The absence of such a system not only leads to frustration but also results in the unnecessary loss of personal items, which could otherwise be easily recovered with a proper solution in place. Our app, Calvin Finds, aims to offer easy item reporting, streamlined item searches, real-time updates, specified locations and community engagement. 

(ignore) Our application is a lost-and-found app for Calvin students called Calvin Finds. It will allow students to post listings about items that have been found, including details about… [posting functionality – map, contact info, picture]. Students will also be able to use a search bar to find listings for what they have lost. …because Calvin does not currently have a formal system for managing lost items.
