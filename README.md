# Calvin Finds

Calvin currently lacks an efficient and organized system for managing lost and found items on campus. Calvin's current system involves lost-and-found boxes around campus and a written record of lost items. The absence of an easily accessible, on demand system not only leads to frustration but also results in the unnecessary prolonged loss of personal items, which could otherwise be easily recovered with a better solution in place. Our app, Calvin Finds, aims to offer easy item reporting, streamlined item searches, real-time updates, identifiable pictures, specified locations and community engagement. 

In contrast to existing apps that cover a broader region, our app is designed exclusively for Calvin students and faculty, offering a simplified experience for lost and found on campus. It features an authentication system and requires minimal personal information, ensuring easy setup, quick posting, and secure communication. This sets us apart from existing options and empowers the Calvin community for seamless lost and found retrievals.
